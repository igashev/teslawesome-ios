This is an **unofficial** iOS app for monitoring and controling your Tesla vehicles. The purpose of being open sourced is just for more visibility and clarity of how the app functions. 

> The app does not store or send any data to any servers except the Tesla ones. All the data that is needed for the app to function properly is stored on the device itself.

> Keep in mind that the app or a number of functionalities might stop working properly at any point in time if for example Tesla's development team change how their backend works.

This project is still heavily under development. Functionalities to expect soon:
- [ ] Complete information about each Tesla vehicle that you own.
- [ ] Widgets for vehicle controls
- [ ] Shortcuts support
- [ ] Siri support
- [ ] Apple Watch app
